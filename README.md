<h1> CSSOS (Computer Science Student Operating System)</h>

Author : Phuong Thanh Nguyen Xiao Chen

Our final Project is to solve the case scenario where computer science students build their own customize operating system based on their needs. 

This project contains the prep folder, which includes the necessary documentation to follow while building the live image. It also contains the source code and the .iso file for anyone who wish to reproduce it. 

The users should be able to choose their own backgrounds, icons, scripts, as well as their source applications. Many scripts files are pre-installed to give more choices to our users. 

The project should be bootable from either an USB stick after flashing the image using online tools like Etcher, or from virtual machine. 

It is Compatible with 64-bit system.
